# GraphSense Connect 2024
## Mastering Volume and Complexity in Cryptoasset Investigations

**Thursday, October 24 at Complexity Science Hub, Vienna.**

As the crypto space continues to grow in both volume and complexity, it is evident that no single solution can address all challenges. To foster collaboration and innovation, we are excited to kick off this year's GraphSense Connect event by inviting our users and partners to share how they are utilizing and integrating GraphSense. We also welcome insights into their visions and wishlists for the future of cryptoasset analytics.
