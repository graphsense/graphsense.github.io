## Storage of Personal Information

GraphSense does not store any personal information. All data points exposed by the demo are drawn from publicly available data sources.


## Site Visit Tracking

Like most Websites, the graphsense.info site tracks site visits to determine the number of people visiting our pages. Although we record data such as device, Internet browser, and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you.

The demo instance [demo.graphsense.info](https://demo.graphsense.info) counts API requests but does not track site visits.


## How we use Cookies

Neither the information page nor the demo instances make use of cookies.

## Your rights as a User

Under the terms of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) you are furthermore entitled to demand that we correct or delete personal data about you or otherwise limit or revoke your permission to us to process it. If you want to exercise those rights or have any questions about them, please contact [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
